This is a makeshift compiler that parses, and interprets code.

All the files in the output folder are the files that compile and run the code input by the user. It runs in a terminal or command prompt window. The grammar is a hybrid version of SML, which is an older language that some schools use to teach coding. 


There is a parser test files folder that shows a bunch of example code that this makeshift compiler will run. The antlr-complete jar file lets the .g file interact with all of the java files. To run it just compile the interpretmain.java file, type in your test code, and then if you're in the terminal press control+d.
